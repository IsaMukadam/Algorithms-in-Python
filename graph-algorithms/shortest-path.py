################ Using Method v2 which solves issue with find_path() ##############

# ðŸ”´ Original Issue in find_path()
# for node in queue:
# The loop only iterates once per element already in the queue at the time of entering the loop.
# New elements added inside the loop arenâ€™t processed.

# âœ… Corrected in find_path_v2()
# while queue:
#   node = queue.pop(0)  # Process nodes in correct order (FIFO)
# Ensures all nodes are explored in the right order.
# BFS correctly finds the shortest path.

# Method find_path doesn't work for the below
print(s.find_path_v2(2, 4)) # [2, 4]
print(s.find_path_v2(1, 5)) # [1, 2, 5]
print(s.find_path_v2(5, 1)) # [5, 2, 1]
print(s.find_path_v2(1, 6)) # [1, 2, 5, 6]
